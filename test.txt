GAME FLOW
1. If the player has not logged in, show a system offline, login to enable system
2. On login, we check memo from player on the wax account 1p3ty.wam - get memoes function
3. If memo exists, we extract the save file
4. We get the asset id from the save file and if the asset is in their wallet, we set the load state
5. The player is loaded into the map they were at (if first time, generate the world by object, assign them sectors, star system and all other stats)
6. The asteroids, npcs and more are generated (for now no save state for them)
7. The player has their resources, the asset id they used and ship stats and can continue to play. They have their HP and asset status 'hull secure or hull breached' determine if they can use the NFT (for now this is ignored).
8. The player can now navigate sectors
9. The player can now click an asteroid and mine it out and the NPCs attempt to mine them as well
10. The player can scan to get a new asteroid
11. The player can fire on an enemy ship to destroy it
12. The NPCs can fire on the player ship and destroy it
13. The player can repair their ship with a button
